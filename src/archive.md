# Archive

I've decided to create an archive. It's a sort of stream of conscious for the web. I find a website or article or blog on the web that I like. Before I'd just copy the url to text file and never really open it again. Or I would open it only for it to be gone with the wind. So now I just put stuff here. There's no real order or rules I've set. No dates either becuase it doesn't really matter. Thoughts aren't really sequential. And they most certaintly don't abide to any calendar.

# My Paradox

My paradoxical relationship with programming (and "The Web").

I enjoy the task of writing code and deploying code on the internet, it's a very rewarding labor. I like writing useful code. Scripts that make my life easier; epedites a task. I like creating solutions to problems I encounter while writing code. It's a very engaging experience. Almost too engaging. It's my form of [structured procrastination](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/).

But I don't enjoy most programs. I don't like most of what the web has become. Producing meaningless code for a meaningless corporations. Code monkeys.

## Paradox v2

*Computing, programming, "The Web"*

All these *ideas*, pure and cool

Yet the purest of ideas are corporeally corrupted
