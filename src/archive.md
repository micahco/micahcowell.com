# My Paradox

My paradoxical relationship with programming (and "The Web").

I enjoy the task of writing code and deploying code on the internet, it's a very rewarding labor. I like writing useful code. Scripts that make my life easier; epedites a task. I like creating solutions to problems I encounter while writing code. It's a very engaging experience. Almost too engaging.

But I don't enjoy most programs. I don't like most of what the web has become. Producing meaningless code for a meaningless corporations. Code monkeys.

*Computing, programming, "The Web"*

Simple and pure concepts.

Perhaps the purest of ideas are corporeally corrupted.
