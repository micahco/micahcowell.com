*What is [/archive](/archive)?*

:	A stream of consciousness

	Sort of a [slip-box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten); or a collection of thoughts that I'll continue to alter

	Entries will continually be created, removed, modified

	The index is sorted by date modified (most recent first)

*Style Guide*

:	Most entries will be a mix of verse/prose/computer language

	A digital journaling style heavily based on hyperlink and blockquote

	The actual styling of this web page is intended to be very minimal

	I don't plan on hosting any media on this site (audio, images, videos)

	~30 lines of css to improve readability; no JavaScript
